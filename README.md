# Astro-Qbasic-Pascal
QuickBasic&amp;Pascal Codes openable with DOS emulator at 32bit clock, for Unixlike systems via dosemu command.
# Astro-QBasic-Pascal
Scope of this repository is to preserve old astronomical codes written during the old past unworking on 64bit-clock computers.
## MeltingPot folder
This is the <i>cooking corner</i> of basic and pascal programs. To perform the interpretated codes of QuickBasic ones, they should be moved here form related store and follow the istructione shown below.

### BASIC_Folder (.BAS) store
Fill here the QuickBasic listouts

### PASCAL_Folder (.PAS) store
Fill here the Pascal listouts

## Howto
Reference is made to any system Unixlike which uses <b>dosemu</b> emulator to be
performed as superuser. 

### Qbasic programs
<PRE>
  1.. Enter into QBASIC folder
  
  2.. Terminal command: sudo -s (superuser)
  
  3.. dosemu QBASIC.EXE
  
  4.. enlarge the red interactive windows of QBASIC, then
      File -> Esc -> Open -> choose the .BAS to run
</PRE>      


### Pascal programs
<PRE>
  1.. Enter into PASCAL folder
  
  2.. Terminal command: sudo -s (superuser)
  
  3.. dosemu TURBO.EXE
  
  4.. File -> DOS Shell

  5.. TPC filename    (not case sensitive)
  
  6.. filename        (to start the executable)  
</PRE>
